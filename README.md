In this assignment, youâ€™ll create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.

Instructions: Final code is in PYCity School folder. 

Observations: 
The dataset comprises of 15 schools, 39,170 students. The total students average reading score is 81.87 which is higher than the average math score 78.98. Looking at all the reading scores and math scores in each table, students tend to do better in reading than in math.


District schools have more students than the charter schools. furthermore, Looking at the top performing schools, bottom performing schools, and passing rates by school type, students have a much higher passing rate in charter schools (~91%) than in district schools (~53%).


As a whole, smaller and medium sized schools dramatically out-performed large sized schools on passing math performances (89-91% passing vs 58%).

Highly budgeted schools like Bailey High School have performed poorly in comparison to low budgeted schools

Lastly, higher the number of students in schools,  the average math scores, average reading scores, passing math, passing reading, and overall passing decreases. 

Hence, it can be inferred that when the students size increases, it influences adversly on the performance of students. Therefore, district and charter schools should focus on size of the class for better results.
